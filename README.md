# Movie Trailer Website

Author: Cheuk Lau

Date: 5/3/2018

In this project, we create a movie trailer website where movie posters
are displayed in tiles. The user can click on specific tiles to play
the corresponding movie trailer. We have included most of the Fast and Furious
franchise, but Fast and Furious 4 and 5 (named Fast and Furious and Fast Five)
are missing due to licensing issues on Youtube preventing the trailers from
properly showing on the webpage.

# Software Dependencies
To run the movie trailer website, you need the following software.
Installation instructions can be found in parenthesis.

-Python (https://www.python.org/downloads/)

-Your favorite web browser e.g., Firefox (https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/)

# Compilation Instructions
To generate the movie trailer website type:
```
python fresh_tomatoes.py
```

# Credits
This project is generated as part of Udacity's full-stack web development
program.
